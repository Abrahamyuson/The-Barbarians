# The Barbarians
Barbarians are now stronger and more annoying. Clearing Barbarian encampment grants a random bonus.

# Mechanism
- Barbarian units are 50% stronger
- Barbarian units gains Strength bonus if within 2 tiles of their camp
- Barbarian melee units gains Strength bonus when stacked with captured Worker and will never attack cities aka never suicide except Suicider
- Barbarians can produce Scout
- New unit: Suicider (Barbarians only)
- Clearing Barbarian encampment grants a random bonus (just like Ancient ruins)
