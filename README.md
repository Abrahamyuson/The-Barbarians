# The Barbarians
Barbarians are now stronger and more annoying. Clearing Barbarian encampment grants a random bonus.

# Mechanism
- Barbarian units are stronger (1.5x for Ancient and Classical, 1.3x for Medieval and Renaissance, 1.2x stronger for the rest)
- Barbarian units gains Strength bonus when stacked with captured Worker and if within 2 tiles of their camp
- New unit: Suicider
- Barbarians melee will never attack cities aka never suicide except Suicider
- Clearing Barbarian encampment grants a random bonus (just like Ancient ruins)
